## üë• Palmoria Group HR Analysis Project

This project is part of my **Data Analysis class** with **The Incubator Hub**, and it's one of the first steps in building my data portfolio.

Over the past two weeks, I‚Äôve been learning how to **analyze real data, clean it, ask questions, and find answers** using tools like **Excel** and **Power BI**.

---

## üìä What This Project Is About

I analyzed HR (Human Resources) data from a company called **Palmoria Group**. The main goal was to check if there are any **differences between male and female employees** in terms of:

* Number of employees
* Performance ratings
* Salaries
* Fair treatment

The result? Palmoria Group seems to be doing a great job at promoting **gender equality**.

---

## üë©‚Äçüíº Gender Distribution

* The company has **481 female** employees and **465 male** employees.
* That‚Äôs a very balanced workforce.
* Men and women are fairly represented across **all departments and regions**.
* There's **no sign of bias** in hiring or placement.

---

## ‚≠ê Employee Performance Ratings

Average number of performance ratings:

* **Male employees**: 212
* **Female employees**: 208

Good ratings:

* **Male**: 82
* **Female**: 98

Poor ratings:

* **Male**: 70
* **Female**: 61

This shows that **performance is judged fairly**, with no special treatment for one gender. In fact, **more women received ‚Äúgood‚Äù ratings** than men.

---

## üí∞ Salary Distribution

Total salary (excluding bonuses): **\$69.72 million**

* **Female employees**: \$34.95 million
* **Male employees**: \$34.78 million

That‚Äôs a very small difference of about **0.3% in favor of women**, showing that **there is no gender pay gap**. Everyone seems to be paid fairly, based on their roles, not their gender.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Minimum Salary Compliance

Palmoria Group has a company rule that every employee should earn **at least \$90,000**. But:

* **654 employees** are currently earning below that amount.
* This issue affects **both men and women**, not just one gender.

It‚Äôs something the company may need to improve, but it doesn‚Äôt show any gender bias.

---

## üíµ Total Compensation (Including Bonuses)

* When bonuses are added, the **total amount paid to all employees** is: **\$71.92 million**.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

* **Power BI** for dashboards and visuals

## üìå Conclusion

The data clearly shows that **Palmoria Group supports gender equality**. There is:

* **No bias in hiring**
* **Fair performance evaluations**
* **Equal pay for men and women**

This was a great project to practice real HR data analysis, and it helped me understand how data can be used to promote fairness in the workplace.
